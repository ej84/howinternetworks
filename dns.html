<h1 style="font-style: inherit; color: #0252c9">What is DNS?<br></h1>

<p style="font-size: 23px; color: green"><br>DNS stands for Domain Name System, which is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.
    The Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over sub-domains of their allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed and fault-tolerant service and was designed to avoid a single large central database.
    <br><br>
    The Domain Name System is also very important in that it specifies the technical functionality of the database service that is at its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the Internet Protocol Suite. Not only that, DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.
    <br><br>
    As one of the DNS example, you can use VPN, a virtual private network. VPN is especially great in that it provides enhanced security, remote control to be used anywhere with Internet connection, and enables you to share many files through the server with the others safely.
