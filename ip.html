<h1 style="font-style: oblique; color:olivedrab">IP Addresses<br></h1>
<img src="images/ipaddress.jpg" alt="">
<p style="color: #28a745; font-size: 20px">
    <br>An Internet Protocol address (IP address for short) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.
    <br><br>Internet Protocol version 4 (shortly IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. However, because of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP (IPv6), using 128 bits for the IP address, was standardized in 1998. IPv6 deployment has been ongoing since the mid-2000s.
    <br><br>An IP address serves two principal functions. It identifies the host, or more specifically its network interface, and it provides the location of the host in the network, and thus the capability of establishing a path to that host. Its role has been characterized as "A name indicates what we seek. An address indicates where it is. A route indicates how to get there." The header of each IP packet contains the IP address of the sending host, and that of the destination host. We can simply think about how we can find our friends and communicate on the Internet.<br>

<h1 style="font-style: normal; color: #16181b">Packets and Routing<br></h1>
<p style="font-size: 20px; color: #721c24;"><br>
    Packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network. A packet consists of control information and user data. The latter is also known as the payload. Control information provides data for delivering the payload (ex: source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, or sequencing information). Generally, control information is found in packet headers and trailers.

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: #721c24;"><br>Typically, in the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, packet strictly refers to a protocol data unit at layer 3, the network layer.[citation needed] A data unit at layer 2, the data link layer, is a frame. In layer 4, the transport layer, the data units are segments and datagrams. Thus, in the example of TCP/IP communication over Ethernet, a TCP segment is carried in one or more IP packets, which are each carried in one or more Ethernet frames. Packets help divide a big data into small pieces so they will be delivered to the receiver safely without being lost or changed in the essence.
<br><br> Now, what is routing and why is it important as well as packets and IP addresses? Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks. Broadly, routing is performed in many types of networks, including circuit-switched networks, such as the public switched telephone network, and computer networks, such as the Internet for the best example.

    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #721c24;"><br><br>There are 3 types of routing:<br><br>
    <br>1.Static routing – A process in which we have to manually add routes in routing table. It is cheap and easy to use but is hard to manage in a big network.
    <br><br>2.Default Routing - Method where the router is configured to send all packets towards a single router (next hop). It doesn’t matter to which network the packet belongs, it is forwarded out to router which is configured for default routing. It is generally used with stub routers. A stub router is a router which has only one route to reach all other networks.
    <br><br>3.Dynamic Routing - It makes automatic adjustment of the routes according to the current state of the route in the routing table. Dynamic routing uses protocols to discover network destinations and the routes to reach it. RIP and OSPF are the best examples of dynamic routing protocol. Automatic adjustment will be made to reach the network destination if one route goes down.
    <br><br>Deciding which type of routing to be used depends on what the Internet environment you use is like. Because a routing metric is specific to a given routing protocol, multi-protocol routers must use some external heuristic to select between routes learned from different routing protocols. Cisco routers, for example, attribute a value known as the administrative distance to each route, where smaller administrative distances indicate routes learned from a protocol assumed to be more reliable.
