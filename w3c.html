<p style="font:icon; color: #721c24;"><br> The World Wide Web Consortium is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. It was founded in 1994 and currently led by Tim Berners-Lee, and the consortium is made up of member organizations that maintain full-time staff working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web.
    It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science(MIT/LCS) with the support from the European Commission, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the ARPANET, one of the predecessors to the Internet. It was located in Technology Square until 2004, when it moved, with CSAIL, to the Stata Center.
    <br><br> The purpose and task of W3C is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the web. The W3C standard formation process is defined within the W3C process document, outlining four maturity levels through which each new standard or recommendation must progress. They maintain working draft(WD), candidate recommendation(CR), and other important roles to rule the Internet cycle well.
    <br><br> The Consortium is governed by its membership. The list of members is available to the public. Members include businesses, nonprofit organizations, universities, governmental entities, and individuals as a lot of variety. Membership requirements are transparent except for one requirement: An application for membership must be reviewed and approved by the W3C. Many guidelines and requirements are stated in detail, but there is no final guideline about the process or standards by which membership might be finally approved or denied.
    The most famous examples of standards from W3C are DOM, CSS, WebAssembly, and XML.

<p style="color: #1b1e21; font-size: 23px"><br>As most of us already know, HTML and CSS are the core framework and stylesheet for a website to be constructed.
They are not programming language like javascript that makes website do some software-like functioning, but are the most important things you should know to build a great website.
<br><br> HTML, short for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser just like this one you see now. HTML almost always works and comes with CSS, the Cascading Style sheet that is responsible for web design in visually good and even artful ways.
Not only HTML forms the entire structure of a website, but it also allows you to link image, document, and other stuffs from your computer or from the other websites to your own ones so you can share your digital creation, attract people who are interested in the same things like you, and do way more innovative things on the website.<br><br>
With CSS's ability to edit font, color or text style, background color and the type of template, and more things like those, you will be able to be a great web developer even if your major is not related to the programming work.
