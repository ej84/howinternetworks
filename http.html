<h1 style="color: #6610f2; font-style: revert">What is HTTP(S)?<br></h1>
<img src="https://cdn.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2019/02/HTTP-Vs.-HTTPs.png" width="700" height="500">
<p style="font-size: 23px; color: #6610f2"><br>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, shortly HTTPS, is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer. So it greatly increases the security level, protects data transmitted between users from cyber attacks, and ensures the information is not going to be lost in the network.
<br><br>So how are http and https different from each other? First of all, HTTP is less secured than HTTPS is because obviously HTTPS uses encryption for transmitted data while HTTP does not. We all know it is the best to play with the Internet stuff in the most safely protected online space with enhanced technology.
    Second of all, No SSL certificates are required for HTTP, with HTTPS it is required that you have an SSL certificate and it is signed by a CA. This should reduce the risk of being exposed to other users you do not know and make sure that your private information on the Internet will always be kept safely.
    <br><br>That is why they usually recommend users to use HTTPS rather than HTTP the old version even if it requires more expensive cost and official certificate from the CA.
    For example, if you don't put any sensitive information on the website browsed in HTTP, that would be ok. However, if you have privately important information, that would be easy to get stolen by hackers or other cyber attacks. In that point, using HTTPS can give you much more advantages for covering all things you perform by the Internet.
